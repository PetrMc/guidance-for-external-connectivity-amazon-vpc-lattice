# Amazon VPC Lattice - Service Network & Service Example (TERRAFORM)

## Code Principles

* Writing DRY (Do No Repeat Yourself) code using a modular design pattern.

## Usage

* Clone the repository.
* Edit the *variables.tf* to:
    * Provide the AWS Region to deploy the environments.
    * Provide the custom domain name and certificate ARN for the Lattice Service.
    * If desired, provide the Hosted Zone IDs and NLB domain name to create the Route 53 records.

## Deployment

* Use `terraform apply` to deploy the resources.
* Use `terraform destroy` to clean-up your environment.
